## Working with records

**ActiveRecord** abstracts database operations to Xojo code. `Record.Save` handles `INSERT` and `UPDATE`. Similarly `Record.Delete` handles the delete. A handy `Record.Clone` function is available.

### Create a record

To create a new record, create a new object and save it

```
var oPerson as new DataFile.t_Person
oPerson.FirstName = "Jean-Luc"
oPerson.LastName = "Picard"

oPerson.Save
```

### Load a record

A row can be loaded by primary key using the Load method

```
var oPerson as new DataFile.t_Person
if oPerson.Load(1) = true then
  // The person record loaded successfully!
  
end
```

### Update a record

Save a record after making changes, the update is automatic!

```
var oPerson as new DataFile.t_Person
if oPerson.Load(1) = true then
  // The person record loaded successfully!
  oPerson.Quote = "To boldly go..."
  oPerson.Save

end
```
